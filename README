***** Further Help *****
If this file doesn&apos;t answer your question, you can find help from several
other places.
First port of call is the website, http://dev-null.chu.cam.ac.uk (sometimes
it&apos;s not there, in which case try http://alistairsserver.no-ip.org:50001).
Then there&apos;s the github page, http://github.com/ec429/quIRC (which should
also have an up-to-date link to the abovementioned website).
Or try our IRC channel, #quirc on irc.newnet.net (if your problem doesn&apos;t
prevent you from joining us there!)
Note: before reporting a bug, check the file wontfix, which lists things which
are known to be wrong but whose fixes would be unacceptably crocky.
***** Commands *****
All commands are prefixed with a &apos;/&apos;. Anything else is a message to
be sent to the channel (or nick if current tab is a private messaging tab).
  /server url
      Connects to the given server (will open in a new tab).
  /nick nickname
      Sets your nickname. Scope is server-wide (or, in (status) tab, sets
      default for new /servers).
  /join channel
      Joins the given channel (will open in a new tab).
  /me action
      Sends an &apos;action&apos; to the channel.
  /msg recipient [message]
      Private message; sends the message to the given recipient. Will open a
      private messaging tab if one is not already open for that recipient. If
      message is omitted, just opens the tab.
  /amsg message
      Send message to all attached channels on this server.
  /topic [message]
      Sets or gets the channel topic.
  /set option [value]
      Sets configuration options; the options are analogous to those in .quirc,
      with one or two extras.
          * The options &apos;height&apos; and &apos;width&apos; are used to
            tell quIRC how many rows and columns your terminal has (for cursor-
            positioning). quIRC will try to deduce these values (from
            environment variables $LINES and $COLUMNS, using defaults of 80x24
            if these env vars are not found), but you can override those
            guesses here or on the command line.
  /ignore [-ipd] user[@host]
  /ignore [-ipd] -r regex
  /ignore -l
      Adds a user to your &quot;ignore list&quot;, thus preventing messages
      from that user from appearing.
        -i
            Match will be case-insensitive
        -p
            Will also ignore matching private messages
        -d
            Instead of adding a rule, remove all rules matching the given
            user@host
        -r
            Supply a regular expression match. The usual form (without -r)
            generates the regular expression ^user[_~]*@host$; if user or host
            are not given (or begin with *), they are replaced with [^@]*
        -l
            Instead of adding a rule, list rules which apply to this tab
  /rejoin
      Rejoins a channel tab which is dead (eg after losing server connection).
  /reconnect
      Reconnects to a server from which you have become disconnected.
  /part channel
  /leave channel
      Leaves (departs) the given channel.
  /disconnect [message]
      Disconnects from the server, optionally sending a &apos;quit
      message&apos;.
  /close
      Closes the current tab. In addition, has an effect which depends on the
      tab type:
        (status)
            Disconnects from all servers and quits quIRC
        {server}
            Disconnects from the server and all channels on that server
        [channel]
            Leaves the channel
  /quit [message]
  /exit [message]
      Quits quIRC, optionally sending a &apos;quit message&apos; to the server.
  /cmd command
      Allows you to send a raw command to the server; not recommended.
  /tab n
      Switches to tab number n; (status) is tab 0.
  /left
  /right
      Swaps the current tab with the tab on its left (or right); tab 0 (status)
      cannot be moved.
  /sort
      Sorts the tab list into an intuitive order (grouping channels after their
      parent servers; maintaining the order of the servers and of each server's
      channels).
***** Configuration *****
quIRC can be configured through an &quot;rc file&quot; as follows.
In your home directory (/home/username), create a file called
&quot;.quirc&quot;, and open it in your editor.
In this file you can set servers, nick and channels to automatically use:
nick global-nickname
ignore -options global-ignore
server url
*chan channel-on-that-server
*nick nick-on-that-server
*ignore -options ignore-on-that-server
where the options to [*]ignore are those for the /ignore command (except for l
and d), and must not be separated by whitespace. You can however combine
options, like -ipr. The options may not be omitted; if none are required, use -
(dash).
Set the maximum length of nick that will be displayed, with lines
mnln maxnicklen
You can also set mirc-colour-compatibility, with
mcc mcc-level
where 0 doesn&apos;t scan for mirc-colours, 1 silently strips them out, and 2
displays the appropriate colour. The default is mcc 1.
Another setting here is force-redraw, with
fred force-redraw
which will redraw the whole screen when things change; the number controls how
often.
0 won't redraw at all, while 3 will redraw every 0.25 seconds. The default is
2, which redraws whenever any buffer is written to or input is entered.
The size of each scrollback buffer, in lines, can be set with
buf buf-lines
the default being 256. Larger values will, of course, increase memory
consumption.
You can turn on a few display options too;
fwc 1
hts 1
tsb 1
will turn on Full-Width-Colour (makes coloured backgrounds for lines (eg. /me)
run all the way across the terminal), Highlight-Tab-Strip (gives the tab strip
a magenta background, to make it more visible) and Top-Status-Bar (uses the top
line of the terminal for some status information). To turn them off replace the
1 with a 0. By default fwc and hts are turned off; tsb is turned on.
These settings and others can be overridden at runtime with commandline
options. For details run &quot;quirc --help&quot;.
You can also customise the colours quIRC uses. A custom colour line starts with
&apos;%&apos;, followed optionally by &apos;S&apos; or &apos;R&apos; (only use
this colour when Sending or Receiving respectively), followed by an identifier,
then space or tab, then four space-separated numbers. Like this:
%[S|R]identfore back hi ul
Fore and Back set the foreground and background colours (8 colours each, red=1
green=2 blue=4, add for mixtures, eg white=7). Hi sets bright, Ul sets
underline; both are true if nonzero.
ident can be any of
  msg
      Ordinary messages
  notice
      Notices
  join
      Channel-Join notifications
  part
      Channel-Leave notifications
  quit
      Quit-messages
  nick
      Nick-change notifications
  act
      Actions (&apos;/me does something&apos;)
  status
      status messages
  err
      error messages
  unk
      Unknown commands (splurged to output)
  unn
      Unknown numerics (splurged to output)
***** Input controls *****
These are based, broadly, on bash's controls.
  Up/Down/PgUp/PgDn
      Read lines from the input history. History is local to the current tab.
  Left/Right
      Move the cursor within the current input line.
  Home
  Ctrl-A
      Move the cursor to the beginning of the input line.
  End
  Ctrl-E
      Move the cursor to the end of the input line.
  Ctrl-C
      Clear the input line.
  Ctrl-X
      Clear everything to the left of the cursor.
  Ctrl-K
      Clear everything to the right of the cursor.
  Tab
  Ctrl-I
      Autocomplete the nickname to the left of the cursor.
  Backspace
      Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
  Ctrl-W
      Delete the word to the left of the cursor. Words are delimited only by
      spaces.
***** Other controls *****
  Ctrl-Up
  Ctrl-Down
      Scroll the current buffer a line at a time.
  Ctrl-PgUp
  Ctrl-PgDn
      Scroll the current buffer a page at a time.
  Ctrl-Home
      Scroll to the top of the current buffer.
  Ctrl-End
      Scroll to the bottom of the current buffer.
  Ctrl-left
  Ctrl-right
      Change tab.
  Alt-[#], where [#] is a number key
      Equivalent to /tab [#]
***** Tab strip *****
The strip of tabs along the bottom of the screen has various indicators.
The parens bracketing the name tell you what kind of tab it is:
  ()
      status
  {}
      server
  []
      channel
  <>
      nick (private messaging)
The background colour is green for the current tab, and blue for the current
tab&apos;s parent server (if applicable).
The foreground colour of tabs other than the current tab will turn red to
indicate that there are new messages on that tab (and flash cyan if a message
contains your nick). If a tab is 'dead' (eg. disconnected from server), it
turns yellow.
***** Troubleshooting *****
  I get several copies of the status line scrolling up my screen!
      One possible cause of this is that your terminal size is not what quIRC
      thinks it is. You may need to /set height and width, or export the
      environment variables $LINES and $COLUMNS from your shell (typically you
      would also add this to your shell's .rc file), or as a last resort resize
      your terminal to 80x24.
      Another possibility is that your terminal emulator isn't recognising
      VT100 escape sequences (which quIRC uses heavily for eg. cursor
      positioning). For details see your terminal emulator's documentation; it
      is known that xterm works out-of-the-box, and that PuTTY has an option to
      enable VT100 support.
