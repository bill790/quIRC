Idea for quIRC scripting interface:
Outboard symbionts, communicating through bidi pipes.
When a line comes in, we tell the script with "rx <TYPE> <from> <chan> <line>".
The script can grab a command with "grab <cmd>", like "grab alias", in which case an input of "/alias foo bar" would be passed to the script instead of being handled in the normal way.  This can be undone with "ungrab <cmd>".  <cmd> may also be a regex.
The script can initiate a command with "tx <command>" (which is then treated as though entered by the user, except that it can't be grabbed by this script).

"rxmode <MODE>" sets the format of |rx| lines; the default is mode 0.
Until an |rxmode| is issued, we don't supply |rx| lines.
Modes:
	0: rx <TYPE> <from> <chan> <line>
		<TYPE> in
			MSG
			NOTICE
			PREFORMAT
			ACT
			JOIN
			PART
			QUIT
			QUIT_PREFORMAT
			NICK
			MODE
			STA
			ERR
			UNK
			UNK_NOTICE
			UNN
			?		(shouldn't happen)
		<from> is either a nick or a server; the former is prefixed with !
		<chan> will contain the leading #
		<line> may contain spaces
	0e: rx <TYPE> <from> <chan> <line>
		As 0, except that spaces and nonprintables in <line> are escaped with \ooo (octal)
	l: as produced by logging with LOGT_SYMBOLIC
