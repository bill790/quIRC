Idea for quIRC scripting interface:
Outboard symbionts, communicating through bidi pipes.
When a line comes in, we tell the script with "rx".
The script can grab a command with "grab", like "grab any 0 alias", in which case an input of "/alias foo bar" would be passed to the script instead of being handled in the normal way.  This can be undone with "ungrab".
The script can initiate a command with "tx" (which is then treated as though entered by the user, except that interaction between tx and grab is undefined).

Every request initiated by the script is prefixed with a token (typically a sequence number) consisting of [[:alnum:]]*, and triggers a response from quIRC (usually "<token> OK", but sometimes "<token> ERR <error-details>").  If the script is working in lockstep (ie. not pipelining requests), it can get away with using the null string for the token; consequently each request will begin with a [[:space:]].

The protocol is specified in the file "qsp".
