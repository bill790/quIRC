==quIRC:readme==

quIRC is a simple terminal-based IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client.  It is written in C.

Getting Help:
	If this file doesn't answer your question, you can find help from several other places.
	First port of call is the website, http://dev-null.chu.cam.ac.uk (sometimes it's not there, in which case try http://alistairsserver.no-ip.org:50001).
	Then there's the github page, http://github.com/ec429/quIRC (which should also have an up-to-date link to the abovementioned website).
	Or try our IRC channel, #quirc on irc.newnet.net (if your problem doesn't prevent you from joining us there!)

Commands: are prefixed with a '/'.  Anything else is a message to be sent to the channel.   (The < and > are just markup, don't type them!)
	/server <url>
		Connects to the given server (will open in a new tab).

	/nick <nickname>
		Sets your nickname.  Scope is server-wide (or, in (status) tab, sets default for new /servers).

	/join <channel>
		Joins the given channel (will open in a new tab).

	/me <action>
		Sends an 'action' to the channel.

	/msg <recipient> <message>
		Private message; sends the message to the given recipient.

	/set <option> [<value>]
		Sets configuration options; the options are analogous to those in .quirc, with one or two extras.
			The options 'height' and 'width' are used to tell quIRC how many rows and columns your terminal has (for cursor-positioning).  quIRC will try to deduce these values (from environment variables $LINES and $COLUMNS, using defaults of 80x24 if these env vars are not found), but you can override those guesses here or on the command line.
			The option 'buf' sets the length (in lines) to be used for the scrollback of any new buffers that are opened.  You cannot (yet) resize the scrollback of existing buffers.

	/cmd <command>
		Allows you to send a raw command to the server; not recommended.

	/part <channel>
	/leave <channel>
		Leaves (departs) the given channel.

	/quit [<message>]
	/exit [<message>]
		Quits quIRC, optionally sending a 'quit message' to the server.

Configuration:
	quIRC can be configured through an "rc file" as follows.
	In your home directory (/home/username), create a file called ".quirc", and open it in your editor.
	In this file you can set a server, nick and channel to automatically use, and the maximum length of nick that will be displayed, with lines
		server <url>
		nick <nickname>
		chan <channel>
		mnln <maxnicklen>
	You can also set mirc-colour-compatibility, with
		mcc <mcc-level>
	where 0 doesn't scan for mirc-colours, 1 silently strips them out, and 2 displays the appropriate colour.  The default is mcc 1.
	Another setting here is force-redraw, with
		fred <force-redraw>
	which is "1 to force redraw, 0 to not".
	These settings and others can be overridden at runtime with commandline options.  For details run "quirc --help".
	You can also customise the colours quIRC uses.  A custom colour line starts with '%', followed optionally by 'S' or 'R' (only use this colour when Sending or Receiving respectively), followed by an identifier, then space or tab, then four space-separated numbers.  Like this
		%[S|R]<ident>	<fore> <back> <hi> <ul>
	Fore and Back set the foreground and background colours (8 colours each, red=1 green=2 blue=4, add for mixtures, eg white=7).  Hi sets bright, Ul sets underline; both are true if nonzero.
	<ident> can be any of
		msg
			Ordinary messages
		notice
			Notices
		join
			Channel-Join notifications
		part
			Channel-Leave notifications
		quit
			Quit-messages
		nick
			Nick-change notifications
		act
			Actions ('/me does something')
		status
			status messages
		err
			error messages
		unk
			Unknown commands (splurged to output)
		unn
			Unknown numerics (splurged to output)

Input controls: At present you cannot edit input with the cursors; you have to backspace.
	Typing part of a nick and then pressing (tab) will cause the nick to be autocompleted.
	Ctrl-A clears the current input.
	Ctrl-left and Ctrl-right change tab.
	Alt-[#], where [#] is a number key, changes to tab [#], where (status) is tab 0.

Scrollback controls:
	You can scroll the current buffer with Ctrl-Up/Dn (and Ctrl-PgUp/Dn) to scroll a line (resp. a page) at a time.
	You can also use Ctrl-Home/End to jump to the top/bottom of the buffer.

Tabs: these have various indicators.
	The parens bracketing the name tell you what kind of tab it is:
		()	status
		{}	server
		[]	channel
	The background colour is *green* for the current tab, and *blue* for the current tab's parent server (if applicable).
	The foreground colour of tabs other than the current tab will turn *red* to indicate that there are new messages on that tab.
