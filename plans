Scripting language.  Under development in branch 'script'.
Debug mode.  /Every/ message send to or from a server to be displayed in that server's buffer; socket operations would be tracked in (status).
curses.  The current hardwired ANSI-escapes code for painting the screen is clumsy.
Interface separation.  The main event loop is currently chock-full of implementation details; it should just be a command parser and marshal.
