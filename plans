==quIRC:future plans==

Scripting language.  Under development in branch 'script'.

Debug mode.  /Every/ message send to or from a server to be displayed in that server's buffer; socket operations would be tracked in (status).

Quiet mode.  Don't emit diagnostics for eg. unrecognised IRC traffic (such as numerics).

curses.  The current hardwired ANSI-escapes code for painting the screen is clumsy.

Interface separation.  The main event loop is currently chock-full of implementation details; it should just be a command parser and marshal.  Some work has been done in this direction (0.4.8 changes) but there's a lot left to do.

Input editing.  Should use something based on Emacs line editing keys (C-a will mean 'go to start of line', unlike now when it means 'backspace to start of line'!).  May be provided by curses - investigate.

w_buf_print().  Wrapper function combining wordline() and buf_print(), as this functionality is duplicated all over the code.

Top status bar.  Carry the info in the xterm title and maybe more info besides.  Here's an idea for a layout that nicely fits things in.
|                           0               16 0               16 0           12

-quIRC-ve.rs.ion-ghashgit---server...foo.bar---#thechannel_name---my_nick_name-
If any string (server, channel, nick) is too long to fit its slot, it will be crushed according to the usual crushing rules.

crush().  Refactored version of the nick-crushing code, that can be applied to any string and max-length.

Pidfiles and attaching.  When you run quirc, if there is an existing quirc process running, your new instance should simply signal that process to open the requested server/channel in a new tab, and the new instance should then close (after emitting a suitable diagnostic).
