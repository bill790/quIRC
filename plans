==quIRC:future plans==

Scripting language.  Under development in branch 'script'.

Debug mode.  /Every/ message send to or from a server to be displayed in that server's buffer; socket operations would be tracked in (status).

Quiet mode.  Don't emit diagnostics for eg. unrecognised IRC traffic (such as numerics).

curses.  The current hardwired ANSI-escapes code for painting the screen is clumsy.  However, it's tailored to my needs, and now that it's neatly packaged away, it should be easier to cope with.  So, I may just stick with it.

Simplify RX parsing.  A command consists of [:<prefix>] +<command>[ +[<arguments>]]; we should pass those three items to each rx_*().  Under development in branch 'parsing'.
Also, the grammar for nicknames was changed in RFC2812, and quIRC needs to be modified to reflect this change.

Urgent Alerts.  When your nick is mentioned, trigger a higher-level alert which causes the tab to flash.

Automate config handling.  Generated code?

Interface separation.  It should be possible to write decoupled interface modules which may access the buffers at a variety of depths (eg. pre-formatting) and through a variety of methods (such as mmap(2), a serialised textual IPC format, etc.).

Private messaging tabs.

Input editing.  Should use something based on Emacs line editing keys (C-a will mean 'go to start of line', unlike now when it means 'backspace to start of line'!).  May be provided by curses - investigate.

append_char().  This should be used for all string appension (eg. fgetl())

quoting/escaping tables.  Instead of duplicative hard-baked logic, we should have a data-driven system with a single point of truth.

http links.  Command /http <n>, opens the nth previous link in web browser.  Links considered to be any word starting "http://"; words are delimited by whitespace.  The actual command run is set with $BROWSER,--browser=,/set browser; %s is replaced with the URL.  If no browser is registered, return an error.  The count <n> is local to each buffer; the most recent link is number 0.  If <n> not specified, defaults to 0.  Also /http <url> opens <url> in web browser, and /http <n><TAB> replaces <n> with the corresponding <url> (so you can check it's the right link, and ^A it if not).

Pidfiles and attaching.  When you run quirc, if there is an existing quirc process running, your new instance should simply signal that process to open the requested server/channel in a new tab, and the new instance should then close (after emitting a suitable diagnostic).
