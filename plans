Scripting language.  Under development in branch 'script'.

Need to fix the problem of the conn_rest not getting called for eg worldofspectrum (why is this happening?)

Tab search: /tab blah<tab>.

Const-correctness.  There are a lot of functions taking a char * that should take a const char *.

Check the return value of malloc (and realloc) everywhere.  At the moment we're lax, which is fine on overcommitting Linux but not elsewhere.

Redesign irc_connect and friends.  At present, we have #ifdef ASYNCH_NL crossing function boundaries in an unpleasantly gnarly way.

Use unicode-charmap (somewhere in system i18n) to find out character widths, for wordline().

/connrest.  Force the conn_rest to be called (to deal with eg. worldofspectrum - see above).

/dump command.  Pipes a screendump (or better still, unprocessed text) into program of choice.

/clear command.

Command tab-completion: /blah<tab>.  Also, command matching and handling should really be refactored; input.c is far too big!

#inclusion and Makefile audit.  Lots of stuff is #included from .h files when it should only be #included from the .c files, some #inclusions may not be reflected in the Makefile, and type definition #include loops should be resolved with types.h instead of relying on placing #includes after typedefs.

Persistent backscroll.

Runtime buffer resizing.

Interface separation.  It should be possible to write decoupled interface modules which may access the buffers at a variety of depths (eg. pre-formatting) and through a variety of methods (such as mmap(2), a serialised textual IPC format, etc.).

quoting/escaping tables.  Instead of duplicative hard-baked logic, we should have a data-driven system with a single point of truth.

http links.  Command /http <n>, opens the nth previous link in web browser.  Links considered to be any word starting "http://"; words are delimited by whitespace.  The actual command run is set with $BROWSER,--browser=,/set browser; %s is replaced with the URL.  If no browser is registered, return an error.  The count <n> is local to each buffer; the most recent link is number 0.  If <n> not specified, defaults to 0.  Also /http <url> opens <url> in web browser, and /http <n><TAB> replaces <n> with the corresponding <url> (so you can check it's the right link, and ^C it if not).  May be unnecessary since you can use /dump command instead

Pidfiles and attaching.  When you run quirc, if there is an existing quirc process running, your new instance should simply signal that process to open the requested server/channel in a new tab, and the new instance should then close (after emitting a suitable diagnostic).
