==quIRC:future plans==

Scripting language.  Under development in branch 'script'.

Debug mode.  /Every/ message send to or from a server to be displayed in that server's buffer; socket operations would be tracked in (status).

curses.  The current hardwired ANSI-escapes code for painting the screen is clumsy.

Interface separation.  The main event loop is currently chock-full of implementation details; it should just be a command parser and marshal.  Some work has been done in this direction (0.4.8 changes) but there's a lot left to do.

Input editing.  Should use something based on Emacs line editing keys (C-a will mean 'go to start of line', unlike now when it means 'backspace to start of line'!).  May be provided by curses - investigate.
