==quIRC:bugs which WONTFIX or NOTABUG==

 *	Pathological error in handling of escape sequence highlighting on cursor movement, input-line crushing etc.  For instance
		\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\003
	will sometimes show
		...(yellow)\\\\(white)003
	instead of correct
		...(yellow)\\\(cyan)\003
	This is essentially because the escape sequences are not self-synchronising in the case of \\.  However, long strings of \\s are so unlikely that the considerable extra processing time /for all input editing/ required to fix is simply not worthwhile.
